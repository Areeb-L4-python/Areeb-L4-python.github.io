        <h2>The Journey of Merryland</h2>
        The dream began when a young graduate decided to take a small step for herself – and a giant leap in the field of education – by seizing the opportunity; albeit a challenging one, of applying her newly ratified thesis on Dalton’s method of education among the Todas, the Badugas and the Kadas of the Niligiri villages. Applying this special method in the field of adult education resulted in pleasant surprises for the young team that she had formed; but the fruits that they tasted were the product of sincere work, outright dedication and total commitment. Charismatic by nature and warm in her manner, the young visionary soon found a place in the hearts of the extremely shy village folk.
        The thesis that was experimented on in the villages of Southern India soon began to take concrete shape in the city of Abu Dhabi and a small school was opened in April 1978.

        </div>
        Based strictly on Dalton’s plan of education, Merryland Kindergarten began functioning with only 7 children, but such was its efficacy in imparting education at the primary level that its population grew by more than ten-fold in a span of six months, warranting a change in premises within the course of its first year of operations. This playhouse of learning concentrated on individual academic performance and personality development. In fact, this home-away-from-home for around 1000 – plus children became a firm testament to enduring academic excellence and service.

        <h2>Sherwood Academy – CBSE (Al Taawan Private School)</h2>
        The success of Merryland Kindergarten fueled further desires in the field of education and Mrs. George soon decided to make further inroads in the field of education. Sherwood Academy was founded in the year 1987 as a sister concern of Merryland Kindergarten and was initially located in the Buteen area with 190 Merryland graduates as its first pupils.

        <h2>International School – Sherwood O level (Al Taawan Private School Branch)</h2>
        The rewards for such toil and pain were soon to be, for in the academic year 1996 – 1997, the institution sent up its first batch of pupils for the CBSE Gulf Board Examinations and beamed with joy at the harvest that was reaped. Beaming with success and certain of more rewards for all the hard work, Mrs. George decided to diversify and cater to the international market as well by offering the IGCSE examination in adherence to the syllabi set by the University of Cambridge Local Examination Syndicate. This division was rewarded with equally good results when its first batch of pupils appeared for the IGCSE examinations in May/June 2000.Thus in another lease land in Mushref, a 75 classroom project was raised for IGCSE curriculum.
        Since then, all three sections,

            Merryland Daltons System of Kindergarten, (Merryland Kindergarten), located at Najda
            Sherwood Academy CBSE (Al Taawan Private School) in Muroor and
            Sherwood Academy O level (Al Taawan Private School Branch) located in Mushref
            <div class="about-image">
                <img src="school branch.jpg" alt="merryland school">
            </div>    
           prospered under Mrs. George’s guidance and have been able to generate better results with time. In fact, such is the quality of education that the school provides and such is the dedication that Mrs. George instills in her teachers that the school is able to generate pupils who are amongst the best achievers in the nation, annually producing Top of the World and Top in UAE award winners.
       <h2>Testament of success</h2>
        Merryland International School with strength of 3,000 pupils and 400 staff is a testament of success; concrete proof of the fact that Mrs. George had enough courage to wear the wings of hope and fly into the skies of achievement. Yes, we have come a long way from the dream that was conceived in the remote hills of Southern India. Surely, no accolade could befit the lady – and the dream – more than the wish to see these storehouses of knowledge and life continue nurturing the generations to come.
