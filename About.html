                    <h2>About Merryland International School</h2>
                    <p>Merryland International School with strength of 3,000 pupils and 400 staff is a testament of success; concrete proof of the fact that Mrs. George had enough courage to wear the wings of hope and fly into the skies of achievement. Yes, we have come a long way from the dream that was conceived in the remote hills of Southern India. Surely, no accolade could befit the lady – and the dream – more than the wish to see these storehouses of knowledge and life continue nurturing the generations to come.</p>
